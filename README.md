# baneasaproject-QA 

This is a manual software quality assurance mock-up project that follows the  SDLC, with an accent on the STLC side of the project that is in a direct corelation with the software manual testing course I've withtaken in the past 4 months.

The documentation provided within this project has been exclusively created by me in relation to a real and active, randomly chosen website (https://www.pastebaneasa.ro/).

The project represents the synthesis of the information developed during the course.
